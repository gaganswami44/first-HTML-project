    <h1>500+ Words Essay on Career</h1>
    <pre><b>Career</b>is a very important thing in oneâ€™s life. Whatever career path you choose to
        follow, it will impact your life greatly. Your career will define your status in a society
        in addition to your lifestyle. In other words, your career will determine your social 
        circle and relationships. </pre>

    <h2>How to Choose your Career?</h2>
    <pre>You must consider a number of factors before deciding on your career. Each factor plays a 
        significant role in your choice. Firstly, always assess yourself thoroughly. You must 
        understand your area of interest to choose a career. For instance, someone who dances well
        can surely become a doctor, but his interest will always be in dance. Thus, ensure that you
        have the caliber to perform well in the field you choose. This will come from your area of
        interest itself.</pre>
